# OpenAI API Integration Requirements

## API Configuration
- Environment variable-based configuration using a `.env` file
- Support for multiple OpenAI models (GPT-4, GPT-3.5-Turbo)
- Configurable API parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
- Proper error handling and retry logic

## Security Requirements
- API key stored in `.env` file (not committed to version control)
- No hardcoded API keys in the codebase
- Secure handling of API responses and user data
- Rate limiting to prevent excessive API usage

## Agent Autonomy Framework
- Base agent class with common OpenAI API interaction methods
- Specialized agent classes for different roles
- Independent reasoning and decision-making capabilities
- Inter-agent communication protocol

## Model Selection
- Default to GPT-4 for complex reasoning tasks
- Option to use GPT-3.5-Turbo for cost-sensitive operations
- Configurable model selection per agent role

## Prompt Engineering
- Specialized prompts for each agent role
- Context management for multi-turn conversations
- System messages to define agent personalities and constraints
- Proper formatting of inputs and parsing of outputs

## Web Search and Data Gathering
- Integration with search APIs for property data
- Web scraping capabilities for property websites
- Data validation and cleaning
- Source attribution for gathered information

## Error Handling
- Graceful handling of API rate limits and errors
- Fallback mechanisms when API calls fail
- Logging of API interactions for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

## Performance Considerations
- Caching of API responses to reduce costs
- Asynchronous API calls where appropriate
- Optimized token usage to minimize costs
- Progress reporting during long-running operations
